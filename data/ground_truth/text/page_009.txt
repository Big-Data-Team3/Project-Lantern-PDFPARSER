Competition
The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry
standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to
customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing
capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we
are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver
consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from
both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better
performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among
competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.
A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, embedded SoCs,
and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect
products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater
marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customers or
technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.
Our current competitors include:
• suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated
computing solutions, including solutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, Huawei
Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;
• large cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated or AI
computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Inc.,
or Amazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and Microsoft Corporation, or Microsoft;
• suppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their internal
solutions or platforms, such as Amazon, Huawei, and Microsoft;
• suppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous
machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated,
Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for their own
products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and
• networking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including optical
modules) include such as AMD, Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company,
Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group as well as internal teams of system vendors and large
cloud services companies.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and
licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates
from February 2024 to August 2043. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign
jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with
our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign
countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our
products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of
our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for innovations and
technologies based on such factors as:
• the location in which our products are manufactured;
• our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
• the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and
• the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.
We have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue entering such license agreements.
