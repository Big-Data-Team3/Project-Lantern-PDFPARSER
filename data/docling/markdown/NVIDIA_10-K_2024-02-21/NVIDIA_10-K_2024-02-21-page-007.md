technologies as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged
investments in research and development: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with shared underlying technology
by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners.We utilize this platform
approachineachofourtargetmarkets.
Extending our technology and platformleadership in Al.We provide a complete,end-to-end accelerated computing platform for
Al, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes full-stack data center-scale compute and networking solutions across
processing units, interconnects, systems, and software. Our compute solutions include all three major processing units in Al servers
-GPUs,CPUs,andDPUs.GPUsareuniquelysuitedtoAl,andwewillcontinuetoaddAl-specificfeaturestoourGPUarchitecture

fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing.We apply ourresearch and development resources to enhance
the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications and create new virtual world and
simulation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental in driving the gaming, design，and creative industries forward， as
developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to deliver an optimized experience on our GeForce and NVIDlA RTX platforms. Our
